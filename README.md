This arduino system opens a valve to overdose with bromine a water circuit during few hours.
This system has two inputs:
  - Signal proceeding from a 4-20mah loop from a bromine reader
  - Digital signal from a programable clock to control the overdosing hours
The output pin switches a relay connected to the dosificating valve
During the overdose hours the valve opens intermitently until desired level of bromine is archieved
